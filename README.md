# mine2020

```
Release process:
export mine2020
rm mine2020.html

git push origin main
```

index.html was improved. That's why we don't want to use default pico8 export.
New index has black screen and the word play in the middle, which I like it more than the ugly play button with the transparent screen.

A play button/click/touch is required as user interaction to start browser sounds.
